>> User: ***I went to the grocer to buy a bag full of tomatoes.*** How much for these tomatoes?
Generator: Twenty-five cents a quart.

>> User: Twenty-five cents? Isn't that a bit much? The place down the street only charges Twenty-two.
Generator: I didn't ask you how much it cost. I didn't know you knew anything about tomatoes.

>> User: I am just looking to get a fair price. Will you give me these for Twenty-two cents a quart?
Generator: Certainly.

>> User: Thank you. This bag is two quarts. How many cents will that be?
Generator: Three cents a quart.

>> User: But sir, you just said Twenty-two. Are you really going to give these to me for three?
Generator: Yes, sir.

>> User: Why?
Generator: Because I am not going to send you any of your tomatoes unless you get your price.

>> User: Aren't you afraid I will tell others they can get their tomatoes from you for such a cheap price? You would be at a great loss...
Generator: No, sir. I don't care how much you tell about it. Are you satisfied with your bargain?

>> User: It is very generous indeed.
Generator: ***I was very glad to hear that. As for myself I was very glad to go to my grocer, as I was in great trouble. I was glad I was not going to get my money back if it was only for fifty cents.***

Generator: And I don't say no, because if I can get them for fifty cents I am sure I can get them cheaper, and then I'll be glad to have them for nothing.

>> User: Well then. Here is six cents for the two quart bag of tomatoes. ***I handed him two coins.***
Generator: Thank you, sir.

>> User: Have a great day!
Generator: ***We parted, with a great feeling of gratitude for Mr. Goodnow. In his kindness, he had been an excellent friend and teacher to me. He was still, I am sure, much more kind than Mr. Goodnow.***
