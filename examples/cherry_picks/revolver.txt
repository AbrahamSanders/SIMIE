Sir George: A what, Jack?

>> Jack: A gun. I intend to shoot you.
Sir George: ***Sir George stared at him for a moment and then said,***

Sir George: No; don't--don't, dear boy; I don't think you know what you are saying.

>> Jack: I know very well what I am saying. You crossed me and now you need to die.
Sir George: I am going to die, dear boy.

>> Jack: Indeed. Do you have any last words?
Sir George: No, dear boy. I can't answer that. What are your last words, Jack?

Sir George: Don't, please, Jack. I am not a coward, but I can't see any good in all this. You ought to be hanged.

>> Jack: Oh, it seems I missed. It's a pity. I only had one bullet.
Sir George: ***But Sir George replied,***

Sir George: You are a coward, Jack, You ought to be hanged.

>> Jack: And you ought to be shot for what you've done to me.
Sir George: Oh, all right. But you must tell me what about, Jack, for I can't be hanged.

>> Jack: ***Jack tossed the empty revolver on the ground next to Sir George.*** I hope I never see you again, sir George, because next time I won't miss.
Sir George: Oh no. The last time it's too dark and you want to know why I never get out a shot. That's my last bullet.

>> Jack: Good night.
Sir George: I hope I'm not dead, dear Jack. I'll tell you soon. You did your best.
